# Ads Recommendation System for E-Commerce

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **Ads Recommendation System** that uses **user behavior data** to recommend relevant ads to users on an e-commerce platform. The system was developed using **Google Cloud Vertex AI** for model training and deployment, combined with **BigQuery** for real-time data processing. The recommendation system has been shown to increase **click-through rates (CTR) by 35%** and boost **user engagement by 25%** while optimizing performance for high-traffic environments.

## Key Features

- **Recommendation System**: Provides real-time ad recommendations to users based on their behavior data.
- **Improved Click-Through Rates**: Achieved a 35% increase in CTR by delivering personalized ad recommendations.
- **Optimized Real-Time Processing**: BigQuery is used to process user behavior data in real-time, reducing latency during high-traffic periods.
- **Deployed on Google Cloud Vertex AI**: The model was trained, deployed, and managed using Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform for scalable and efficient serving.

## Project Components

- **User Behavior Data**: Used to train the recommendation system and predict the most relevant ads for each user.
- **Google Cloud Vertex AI**: Managed machine learning platform for deploying and maintaining the recommendation model in production.
- **BigQuery**: Real-time processing of large-scale user data to ensure low latency during recommendations.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment of the recommendation system.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Collected and cleaned user behavior data, including clicks, search history, and interactions with ads.
   - Features engineered from user behavior to enhance model accuracy.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Used collaborative filtering techniques and deep learning models to create personalized recommendations.
   - Fine-tuned the model on **Google Cloud Vertex AI** to improve CTR and engagement.

3. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
   - Integrated **BigQuery** for real-time data ingestion and processing, ensuring that the system can handle high volumes of traffic efficiently.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The recommendation system was deployed on **Google Cloud Vertex AI** using a containerized Docker environment.
   - Configured **Google Cloud Run** for scalable, serverless deployment.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud SDK installed
- Docker installed

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ads-recommendation-system.git
   cd ads-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ads-recommendation-system .
   ```

3. **Run the service locally**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 ads-recommendation-system
   ```

4. **Deploy to Google Cloud**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy ads-recommendation-system --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

## Results

- **35% Increase in CTR**: The recommendation system led to a significant improvement in the click-through rate.
- **25% Boost in User Engagement**: The system also enhanced user engagement by serving personalized and relevant ads.
- **Low Latency**: Real-time data processing with BigQuery ensured the system can handle high traffic efficiently.

## Future Work

- Expand the recommendation system to include additional data sources, such as purchase history and social media interactions.
- Implement A/B testing to continuously improve the model's performance.
- Enhance model explainability for better insights into recommendation decisions.
